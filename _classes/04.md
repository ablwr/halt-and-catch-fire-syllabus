## Description

*Episodes: - S1E7	"Giant", S1E8	"The 214s", S1E9 "Up Helly Aa"*

During these episodes, the characters are mostly in the throes of wrapping up production for their computer: the design of a case, the stealing of the important parts that make the computer significant, the OS, and presentation of the final product at [COMDEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMDEX). We get to see the creative thinking around computer production, but not the stories of the hands that created and shaped plastic, assembled the microprocessors together, and prepared pretty much everything else related to computer production and distribution.

Computers allow us to forget about tangible objects, but they are still part of larger material supply chains.
