## Description

*Episodes: - S2E9	"Kali", S2E10	"Heaven Is a Place", S3E1	"Valley of the Heart's Delight"*

Some strife is a normal part of life (e.g. marrying Joe MacMillan despite all the red flags), some of it is compounded by the stress of working within the tech industry (the now-stereotypical culture of Silicon Valley workaholism), and some of it is directly a result of the work (Gordan's health issues attributed to lead and cocaine). How did we get here then, where are we now, and where are we going?

This is a good opportunity to pause and think about what stories are not being told within the histories of technology.
