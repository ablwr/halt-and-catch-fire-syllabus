## Description

_Acknowledgement that the episodes reviewed during this class focus on stress and emotional health, and suicide. This topic was intentionally covered in Class 8, although this class ties the Ryan character with the late Aaron Swartz. It is in honor of Aaron's legacy that this class focuses on the free and open internet. This class should shine light on Aaron's beliefs and massive, positive impact on the world, not the way through which he left it._

*Episodes: - S3E5 "Yerba Buena", S3E6 "And She Was", S3E7 "The Threshold", S3E8 "You Are Not Safe" cw: [suicide]* (FOUR this week)

The narrative told about the early web, immediately after the embargo on commercialization was lifted, was this story about how the web is a free and open "superhighway" with unprecedented access to all of the world's information.
