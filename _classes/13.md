## Description

*Episodes: - S4E4 "Tonya and Nancy", S4E5 "Nowhere Man", S4E6 "A Connection is Made"*

Search versus curation starts to become the next big thing. There is tension between whether it's more valuable to offer a complex search algorithm versus having experts curate useful links: quantity versus quality. [Rover](http://www.roversearch.net/) and [COMET](http://www.cometlist.net/) represent these two perspectives. Although not given as much hype as the Browser Wars (See #14), this tension between the size and complexity of the web and how to provide a portal with meaningful access is an important one. 

Today, google reigns supreme in search (and search advertising) to the point of [government lawsuit](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/technology/google-antitrust.html), but social sites have created an evolved form of the curated access to information (even if not the 'quality' of experts, as misinfo runs rampant).
