<div class="prompts" markdown="1">
## Prompts  
- Where's the line between software and hardware, and how has it changed over time?
- When did computers start having a personality? What are the implications behind having computers become "friendlier"?
- Why does the Macintosh continue to live so strongly in cultural memory?

## Description

*Episodes: - S1E4	"Close to the Metal", S1E5	"Adventure", S1E6 "Landfall"*

This episode block starts with data loss, demagnetization, and data restoration. (And manipulation and press influence, too.) Where did memory used to be stored, and when did computers start storing data on detachable drives, like the 5 1/4" floppy disks featured in Episode 4?

S1E6 starts to move from worrying about a PC's hardware to worrying about the software that comes packaged with the machine. This is building up to the reveal (a few episodes from now) of the Apple Macintosh and its focus on interface design and making the computer have a "personality".
