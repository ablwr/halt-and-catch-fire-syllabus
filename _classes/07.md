## Description

*Episodes: - S2E6	"10Broad36", S2E7	"Working for the Clampdown", S2E8	"Limbo"*

This story arc prominently features the concept of time-sharing and network-sharing, and the infrastructure that allows these pieces to all come together. The larger question looming for the characters is around infrastructure and control. Owning a mainframe means having full control of one's data; leasing it means risking losing that control.
