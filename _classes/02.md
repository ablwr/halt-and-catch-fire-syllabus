## Description

*Episodes: - S1E1	"I/O", S1E2	"FUD", S1E3	"High Plains Hardware"*

The first three episodes introduce the characters and the relationships they have with computers. In 1983, the personal computer is not a totally new concept. IBM is the dominant force with a lot of smaller companies seeking to be the cheaper alternative model. This allows the series to start off under the guise of the "two men in a garage" cliche of U.S. technology history while actually situating it in a common small and boring tech company, like many others across the country.
